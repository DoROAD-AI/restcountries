If you want to donate to **this** project to help me pay the server bill, you are welcome to donate 
[$5], [$10], [$15] o [more]. I would very much appreciate the help ðŸ˜ƒ

The original restcountries project was acquired by apilayer, one of the leading providers of 
API microservices. As the original project has shown very little activity, I created this project 
in order to provide a more updated version and with some fixes requested in the original project.
